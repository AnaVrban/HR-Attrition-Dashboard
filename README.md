# HR-Attrition-Dashboard

This project is using the "HR-Employee Attrition.csv" Kaggle dataset containing employee satisfaction metrics and descriptive information regarding the employees. The goal of the project was to build a HR-analyics solution in Power BI. This involved some data cleaning and transformation in Power query but also some DAX calculations. The end result was a dashboard containing one page with three KPI's that showed a major impact on the attrtion rate. 

The KPI's 
 - Average Job Satisfaction
 - Average Involvement
 - Average Environment Satisfaction

With these KPI's, I was able to calculate the difference from average (outliers) when filtering on specific departments, Roles, Gender but also wether an employee have quit or not.

In the picture below, you can see the measure for all female research scientist at the company, indicating a % difference of job satisfaction of -18% compared to the rest of the company. The page, also provides the user a full list of all employees of the selection for further deep dive.
